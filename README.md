# Automating Technical Analysis and Strategy Backtesting with Python

This Jupyter Notebook accompanies the article titled ["Automating Technical Analysis and Strategy Backtesting with Python"](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/automating-technical-analysis-and-strategy-backtesting-with-pyth) on [LSEG Developer Portal](https://developers.lseg.com/en). In this article, I will be using some awesome packages to show you how simple it is to get started with automating the generation of technical analysis features. I will then go on to use these features to generate some simple systematic trading strategies that I will then backtest. This is about the simplest workflow that I have seen for this. I hope you will be pleasantly surprised.
